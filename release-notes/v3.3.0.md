## v3.3.0

This release improves how the tool decides whether changes are user-facing or internal when generating changelogs and release notes. It also strengthens support for .NET projects so version bumps better reflect changes in the library itself.

### Highlights

- Improved .NET handling so changes under a project’s directory are treated as user-facing when appropriate.
- More accurate classification of changes (public vs internal vs tests), with better defaults and clearer overrides.

### For Non-Developers

If you use this tool to publish releases, you should see more consistent release notes and version bumps. In particular, .NET libraries are less likely to miss a version bump when changes happen inside the library’s folder.

### Upgrade Guide (Developers)

**Action required:** No.

If you call the pipeline APIs directly and want to control how files are classified, you can now optionally provide a default classification override policy and still allow per-path overrides to take precedence.

### Fixes

- Expanded test-file detection so changes in additional common test folder patterns are treated as test-only changes.
- Improved default behavior for .NET projects so changes in the project directory are recognized as user-facing and reflected in versioning.
