# Release Notes (4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904..v0.1.0)

# ai-publish – Initial Release

This is the first public release of **ai-publish**, an AI-assisted release authoring tool for repositories that use Git.

## Overview

ai-publish helps you:

- Analyze diffs and classify changes.
- Detect potential breaking changes.
- Generate high-quality changelogs and release notes.
- Compute the next semantic version based on changes.
- Update language-specific manifests as part of a release workflow.

It is available both as a CLI (`ai-publish`) and as a typed programmatic API for Node.js (Node 18+).

## CLI

- Adds an `ai-publish` command-line tool wired to the package, enabling you to drive changelog, release-notes generation, and version-bump flows from the terminal.

## Programmatic API

The public TypeScript API exposes functions to:

- Work with Git-based diffs and evidence for changes.
- Detect breaking changes and validate changelog models.
- Resolve instructions that guide how releases are generated.
- Run end-to-end pipelines for:
  - Changelog generation
  - Release notes generation
  - Version bump computation
  - Pre-publish and post-publish tasks
- Interact with LLMs via OpenAI and Azure OpenAI through configurable clients.
- Compute base versions from Git tags, determine bump types, and calculate the next version.

These APIs are available via the main package entrypoint and are fully typed for TypeScript consumers.

## Multi-ecosystem Versioning Support

- Includes manifest handling and runners for .NET, Go, npm, Python, and Rust projects.
- Supports computing and applying version bumps across these ecosystems as part of a unified release pipeline.

## Reliability and Tooling

- Configured as a modern Node.js package with strict TypeScript settings and a separate build configuration.
- Includes comprehensive automated tests covering diff handling, changelog and release-notes generation, LLM interaction and gating, manifest updates, versioning logic, and end-to-end pipelines.

No breaking changes are applicable for this initial release.
