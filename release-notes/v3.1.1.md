## v3.1.1

This release improves version base detection for repositories that don’t use version tags, making prepublish/version bump workflows more reliable. It also adds clearer diagnostics when no changes are detected.

### Highlights

- Added a new `--previous-version-from-manifest-history` option for `prepublish`, allowing the tool to infer the previous version from the manifest’s git history when tags aren’t available.
- Programmatic usage now supports `previousVersionSource?: "manifest" | "manifest-history"` in `PrepublishArgs`, enabling the same behavior via API.

### Fixes

- Improved error messaging when `bumpType` is `"none"`, including more context about how the base/previous version was resolved and guidance for bootstrapping tagless repos and debugging base selection.
