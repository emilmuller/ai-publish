# Release Notes (v0.0.0..v0.0.1)

## Breaking changes

- Raised the minimum supported Node.js version to 18.0.0. Make sure your runtime is Node 18+ before upgrading.

## Features

- Integrated the official OpenAI Node SDK and now prefer the OpenAI Responses API for completions, with automatic fallback to the existing chat-completions path when needed.
- Added support for the Azure OpenAI Responses API, including mapping from existing chat-style requests and support for reasoning configuration.

## Improvements

- Improved Azure completion behavior by normalizing `maxTokens` from both environment and request, handling array-style message content, and better handling problematic deployments (including a fallback to the Responses API when appropriate).
- Relaxed hard-coded Azure token limits so environment or client defaults can govern budgets, and increased the semantic pass limit to allow larger responses.
- Switched the project license to MIT.
- Added a shared OpenAI client helper internally to centralize and cache HTTP client creation for both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI, improving efficiency and consistency.

## CLI & configuration

- Added a `--debug` flag to all CLI subcommands and corresponding `AI_PUBLISH_DEBUG` / `AI_PUBLISH_DEBUG_CLI` environment variables. When enabled, the CLI emits structured diagnostic logs to stderr and can show full error stack traces to help with troubleshooting.
- Updated CLI validation for `--project-type` and `--llm` to use centralized validation logic, preserving the set of supported values while making error handling more consistent.

## Reliability & diagnostics

- Made the changelog and release-notes pipelines more robust: invalid hunk IDs or snippet failures now produce empty results with debug logs instead of hard failures, and added richer debug logging across key stages of the prepublish flow (including version computation and tagging).
- Improved the unified diff indexing and repo-snippet retrieval to better handle fast child-process exits and missing files at specific refs, reducing spurious errors.
- Updated tests to cover the more permissive behavior of diff-hunk lookups, ensuring pipelines continue successfully even when some requested hunks are unavailable.
