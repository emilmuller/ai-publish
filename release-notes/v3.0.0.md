## v3.0.0

This release improves the `postpublish` workflow with more control over how (or whether) the publish step runs, and refines .NET package publishing behavior.

### Highlights

- Added `--publish-command <cmd>` to run a custom publish command as part of `postpublish`.
- Added `--skip-publish` to run `postpublish` without performing a publish step.
- The programmatic `postpublish()` API now supports `manifestPath`, `publishCommand`, and `skipPublish`.

### Breaking Changes

- `postpublish` now treats `publishCommand` and `skipPublish` as mutually exclusive.

  **Action required:** If you were setting both, update your usage to choose exactly one.

### Fixes

- Improved .NET package discovery and publishing behavior, including better filtering to the predicted version (when available) and more predictable NuGet source selection (only passing an explicit source when configured).
