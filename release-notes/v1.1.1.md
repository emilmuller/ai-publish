## v1.1.1

This release improves the safety and reliability of the postpublish pipeline when used together with npm’s built-in publish lifecycle.

### Highlights

- Prevents recursive double-publish behavior by detecting when the postpublish pipeline is already running as part of npm’s own `postpublish` lifecycle and skipping an extra `npm publish` invocation in that case.

### Fixes

- Ensures the postpublish pipeline completes successfully under npm’s `postpublish` lifecycle without re-running `npm publish`, while still pushing the expected new tag to the remote.

### Performance

- Internal stability improvements to the postpublish pipeline behavior under npm lifecycle environments.
