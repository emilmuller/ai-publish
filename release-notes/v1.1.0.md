## v1.1.0

This release focuses on more predictable release-note output and more robust handling of diff data within the LLM pipelines.

### Highlights

- Bullets within each section are now deterministically sorted, so repeated runs over the same input produce stable, reproducible release notes.
- Release notes now use a fixed, deterministic section order (Highlights, Breaking Changes, Fixes, Deprecations, Security, Performance), and any unsupported sections are automatically ignored.

### Performance

- Diff hunks are now fetched through a shared helper that enforces a global byte budget, improving robustness when working with large diffs.
- Test execution is tuned to use a small thread pool, which can improve reliability and performance on Windows environments.
