## v2.1.0

This release improves the reliability and configurability of the release automation pipelines, with better handling of language-specific manifests and LLM integrations. It also refreshes documentation and tests to better reflect current behavior.

### Highlights

- Enhanced release, changelog, and prepublish pipelines for more predictable behavior when running from the CLI or programmatically.
- Improved handling of versioning across multiple ecosystems (including .NET, npm, Python, and Rust) to make automated version bumps more consistent.
- Refined documentation and built-in release notes to clarify how to configure and run the tool in common workflows.
- Updated LLM client integrations (including Azure-hosted and OpenAI-based flows) to better align with current APIs and configuration options.

### Fixes

- Expanded and updated test coverage for CLI arguments, version resolution, and prepublish behavior to reduce regressions.
- Improved logging and error handling across pipelines and LLM calls to make failures easier to diagnose.
- Increased robustness of diff and changelog generation logic to better cope with complex or large diffs.

### Performance

- Internal performance improvements in diff processing and pipeline execution, which may reduce runtime on larger repositories.
