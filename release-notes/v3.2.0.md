## v3.2.0

This release improves the quality and consistency of generated release notes by adding clearer, audience-specific sections and enforcing stricter validation. It helps ensure release notes are easier to understand for non-developers while still providing actionable guidance for developers when upgrades require changes.

### Highlights

- Release notes generation now supports two additional canonical sections: “For Non-Developers” and “Upgrade Guide (Developers)”, with a deterministic section order.
- The pipeline now rejects release notes that include “### Breaking Changes” without also including “### Upgrade Guide (Developers)”.
- Unknown “### …” sections are now removed to keep output consistent and predictable.

### For Non-Developers

- If a release requires people to do something differently, the release notes will now be required to include clear, step-by-step instructions for developers.
- Release notes will be easier to read and more consistent from release to release, with a dedicated plain-language section explaining what changed and why it matters.

### Upgrade Guide (Developers)

**Action required:** No.

- If you generate release notes using this package, you may see two new sections (“For Non-Developers” and “Upgrade Guide (Developers)”) and a more consistent section order.
- If you provide or post-process release notes that include “### Breaking Changes”, ensure an “### Upgrade Guide (Developers)” section is also present, or generation/validation will fail.
- If your workflow expects custom “### …” sections, update it to rely only on the supported canonical sections, since unknown sections will be dropped.

### Fixes

- Expanded deterministic tests to cover ordering and bullet sorting for the new sections, and to ensure unknown sections are removed.
