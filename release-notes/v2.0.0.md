## v2.0.0

This release updates the package’s release workflow naming and aligns the documentation with the new command, without changing runtime behavior.

### Highlights

- Internal release workflow has been clarified and renamed, with documentation updated to match the new command name.

### Breaking Changes

- The npm script previously named `publish` has been renamed to `release`. **Action required:** Update any automation, CI pipelines, or local workflows that invoke `npm run publish` to use `npm run release` instead.
