## v1.2.0

This release improves how changelogs and release notes are generated, especially around tagged releases and internal-only changes, and clarifies the documented behavior of the pipeline.

### Highlights

- Changelog rendering now replaces sections that only contained internal or tooling notes with a generic user-facing line, so you still see a meaningful summary even when internal details are filtered out.
- When the current commit is already tagged, both the CLI and programmatic APIs now compute diffs from the previous version tag to the current HEAD, aligning behavior across interfaces.

### Fixes

- Ensured that internal-only changelog bullets mentioning tooling or file paths are dropped from the final output and replaced with a generic “Performance and stability improvements.” line instead of leaving sections blank.

### Performance

- Internal improvements to version-base resolution and changelog rendering, backed by additional tests, to make release generation more predictable and robust.
